<h2>Hello Stranger,</h2>
I'm Swarup, currently on my track to graduate with BS in Computer Science and Engineering, with concentration in Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering. 
<br>
If you're thinking, I'm a total nerd who sits in front of a computer everyday for more than 15 hours, then you're not completely wrong! :grimacing: I do that when I'm in a time crunch, but other time, I take pleasure in dissimilar activites.
<br><br>
I like to workout, play sports, read manga, learn new skills, and anything that catches my attention. 
<br>

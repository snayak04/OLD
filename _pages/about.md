I'm a regular guy, with high aspiration... 

Just like every sensible person, I want to develop my skills and be the best version of myself. I spend most of my free time on YouTube, Reddit, and playing sports. I also enjoy in leadership opportunities and am always involved in somekind of organization/ club. I also have a lot of ongoing online classses that I also go through when I can digest more information, which are usually in the weekends.

They say, if you let everyone know of your goals, then you have an incentive to work on achieving them. I have so many on my to do list, that it would be hard to even list them here, so I would list a few of the important ones:

* Build something that will benefit the world, and provide at a minimal to no cost.
* Develop my social skills, for better long term relation with everyone.
* Go on a world tour.
* Be able to support my family and friends when needed.
* Start a YouTube channel.
